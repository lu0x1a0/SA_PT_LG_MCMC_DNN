Dear Resonate Recruitment,

I'm an penultimate university student studying Computer Science and Advance Mathematics (Statistics) with solid programming experience with python, JavaScript and Java.  

I've achieved an average mark over 80 for all my computer science courses. My final project was a interactive online multiplayer game written with Node.js in an agile development manner. The project included an AI that utilizes graph for map traversal. This project was both deployed on Heroku automatically with the inbuild CI/CD function as well as on Google Cloud Platform via a server instance.

During other courseworks I've had experience with Database design and have strong fundamentals in algorithms and data structures.

I currently have an ongoing side project that is a text based rpg game written in react native.

To address the eligibility, I'm an Australian citizen.

Thank you for reviewing my application.

Sincerely,

Sean Luo.
